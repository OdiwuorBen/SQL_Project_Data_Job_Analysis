3. What skills are most in-demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?
# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. 
Here is how I approaced each question:
### 1. Top paying data analyst jobs.
To identify the highest paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the highest paying opportunities in the field.

SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
Here is the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Wide Salary Range:** Top 10 paying data analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000 indicating significant salary potential in the field.
